# Format the output of git-push, git-show-ref and other commands to make a
# user-friendly and stable text.  We can easily prepare the expect text
# without having to worry about future changes of the commit ID and spaces
# of the output.  Single quotes are replaced with double quotes, because
# it is boring to prepare unquoted single quotes in expect text.  We also
# remove some locale error messages. The emitted human-readable errors are
# redundant to the more machine-readable output the tests already assert.
